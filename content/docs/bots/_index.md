# Chat bots

jfa-go can send messages (password resets, announcements, etc.) via Email and/or chat bots for Discord, Telegram & Matrix. You can choose which specific methods to use for a Jellyfin user on the Accounts page once you've connected an email address or user to them.

Setup varies in difficulty, see the sidebar for guides on each.
